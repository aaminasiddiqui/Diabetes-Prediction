### Overview

___

The code implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using TensorFlow to predict the risk of diabetes. It features dense layers and utilizes KerasTuner to optimize the learnable parameters. The model leverages health metrics and demographic data for prediction.
The process includes:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, normalize features, and split into training and testing sets.
   
2. **Model Definition**: Building the ANN model with dense layers, specifying activation functions, and compiling the model with an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
   
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using KerasTuner to search for the best hyperparameters, such as the number of neurons, learning rate, and batch size.

4. **Model Training**: Training the model on the training data while validating on a separate validation set to monitor performance.
   
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model on the test set to determine its accuracy and other relevant metrics.
   
6. **Prediction**: Using the trained model to predict diabetes risk on new data.
